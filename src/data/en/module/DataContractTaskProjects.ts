> This game is my **project with the highest technical content**, involving **multi-platform release, backend server, CI/CD, multi-platform packaging, resource management, hot compilation, EUI configuration interface generation, reflection technology, hard link technology, performance, CDN strategy, resource anti-theft, Android and iOS incremental hot update** and more.

> It is worth mentioning that the game has been online for nearly 10 years, and many **new technologies have matured** in Html5 development. The game still has a lot of room for improvement in **image quality and smoothness**.

> *Developed based on the Egret engine. Before developing this game, I already had experience with **four community architectures** (Bao Bao City predecessor, Bao Bao City, Molang Manor 1, Molang Manor 2). I upgraded the architecture details again to support super-large community projects. I independently designed and implemented a complete set of toolchains similar to Webpack, optimizing the project's construction and resource management.*

> *During development, I used reflection technology to dynamically generate EUI configuration interfaces, thereby reducing the size of configuration files and improving performance. In addition, the entire project supports hot compilation, greatly improving development efficiency.*

> ![Image](images/game/4/3.webp)   
> *In terms of project architecture design, I strictly separated the resources, UI source files, release resources, and documents of each module, and linked the relevant resources to the corresponding modules through hard link technology, further improving workflow efficiency. The project involves **multi-platform packaging**, **backend server**, and **CI/CD**, considering the collaborative work of frontend, backend, and operations to ensure the efficient operation and easy maintenance of the system.*
