Through this project, I hope to not only optimize my own job search experience but also help more people find more suitable opportunities.\n\n**Project Achievements**: Provided a flexible and efficient resume generation tool to help users stand out in the job search and receive positive feedback.\n\n#### [FlexiResume Open Source Project ![github](/images/github.svg) *https://github.com/dedenLabs/FlexiResume.git*](https://github.com/dedenLabs/FlexiResume.git)\n> \n'},{company_name:"XCast Configuration Generation Collaboration Tool",start_time:"2024/09",end_time:"Present",position:"Completed Independently",description:'---\n<p align="center">\n    <img class="no-effect-icon" src="images/xcast.webp" alt="XCast" style="width:60%">\n</p>\n    <p align="center" style="font-size:3rem">\nXCast\n</p>\n\n**Project Overview**  \n> XCast is an Excel conversion tool designed specifically for game development, software configuration management, and other fields, supporting efficient conversion of Excel files to JSON or CSV formats.\nThis tool is particularly suitable for projects that rely on complex data configurations and multi-person collaboration (such as numerical planning or configuration information management),\nit can generate parsing class files for various programming languages and frameworks, providing code hints and Markdown format comments for users, greatly improving development efficiency and data management standardization.\n\n**Project Achievements**  \n> The XCast project once participated in the **Wing IDE Developer Plugin Competition** hosted by Egret Whiteé¹­ Engine and won the first prize.\nThis version is a desktop application based on Adobe Air, developed with AS3 language, with complete functions but not conducive to modern expansion.\nWith the increasing demand for open source, the source code conversion work has recently been launched, aiming to support a wider range of development environments and user needs, and the open-source release is also imminent.\n\n> #### [XCast Open Source Project ![github](/images/github.svg) *https://github.com/dedenLabs/XCast.git*](https://github.com/dedenLabs/XCast.git)\n\n**Core Features**  \n\n- **Multi-Language Support**: Facilitates the application of global projects, supporting multi-language configuration.\n- **Strict Typing and Complex Fields**: Provides strict type checking for fields and supports flexible configuration of complex field relationships (such as "reference", "interface", "nested"), ensuring data consistency and integrity.\n- **Multi-Platform Parsing Class Generation**: Can generate parsing classes for various target environments (such as TypeScript, Unity, Unreal Engine, Node.js, Go, Python, C++, etc.), providing developers with efficient code ready to use.\n- **Code Hints and Comment Support**: The generated parsing class files support code hints and automatically obtain comments (Markdown format) from Excel, facilitating developers to quickly grasp the configuration content.\n\n**Application Scenarios**  \nXCast is particularly suitable for game development projects and enterprise software configuration management needs that require high configuration file and numerical settings:\n\n- **Game Development**: Suitable for numerical planning, logic configuration, and multi-person real-time collaboration development projects, solving version management and data consistency issues.\n- **Enterprise Software Configuration**: Suitable for managing and standardizing configuration data of software projects, achieving efficient synchronization, conversion, and use.\n\n**Technology Stack**  \nXCast will be refactored using modern technology stacks to enhance scalability and adaptability, enabling it to run efficiently on various development environments and systems.\n'}]};export{e as D};
